Body motion data collected by wearable media while performing a bicep curl
are analyzed in an attempt to classify the quality of the exercise.
Six participants performed bicep curls with dumbbells in five different fashions:
(A) perfectly, (B) throwing the elbows to the front, (C) lifting the dumbbell only half way,
(D) lowering the dumbbell only halfway, and (E) throwing the hips to the front. 
The wearable media were located on the participants' arm, forearm, waist, and dumbbell. 
The data consist of 19,622 observations of 160 variables and are classified using a random forest. 
The accuracy of the model, when applied to a validation set, is 96%.
